Tensors are a fundamental data structure in PyTorch, serving as the primary building blocks for constructing and manipulating data in machine learning and deep learning tasks. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive overview of tensors in PyTorch:

What is a Tensor?
A tensor is a multi-dimensional array that generalizes the concept of scalars, vectors, and matrices. Just like NumPy arrays, tensors can represent a variety of data types and are used to store and manipulate data efficiently.

Key Characteristics of Tensors
Dimensionality:

Tensors can have different dimensions:
0D Tensor: Scalar (e.g., a single value)
1D Tensor: Vector (e.g., a list of values)
2D Tensor: Matrix (e.g., a table of values)
3D Tensor: A collection of matrices (e.g., images with height, width, and channels)
nD Tensor: Higher-dimensional data (e.g., sequences, volumes)
Data Types:

Tensors can hold various data types, including:
torch.float32 (default)
torch.int64
torch.uint8
And others (like torch.float64, torch.int32, etc.)
Device Support:

Tensors can be created and manipulated on different devices (CPU and GPU), allowing for efficient computation, especially in deep learning applications. You can move tensors between devices using the .to() method.
Automatic Differentiation:

PyTorch tensors can track gradients, which is crucial for training neural networks. By setting requires_grad=True when creating a tensor, PyTorch will automatically compute gradients during backpropagation.
